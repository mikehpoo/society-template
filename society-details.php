//Who are we 
$whoAreWeDescription = "
					One of the university’s oldest societies, the Adventure Gaming Society is a friendly, inclusive group that helps people meet to play roleplaying games (like Dungeons & Dragons), 
					board games (like Pandemic), card games (like Magic: The Gathering), and war games (like Warhammer 40,000).<br><br>
					Every term-time Saturday we take over some seminar rooms (usually in Keynes College from 2pm) and welcome anyone who wants to play; 
					we have a library of games and our members usually bring more.<br><br>
					We can also help you to establish your own regular gaming sessions by booking campus venues and putting you in touch with players, so get in contact and have fun!";
